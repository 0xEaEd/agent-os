"""Uniswap V4 liquidity read-outs for LP cards (``application/vnd.agentos.lp+json``).

``docs/lp-cards.md`` is the contract: four payload kinds (``pool``, ``ranges``,
``position``, ``positions``), one envelope, amounts as decimal strings and USD
values that are ``null`` -- never ``0`` -- when no price is known.

Every chain read goes through the V4 library that ships with the bundled
``senior-unilp-manager`` skill (``scripts/unilp``: pure stdlib, exact TickMath,
launchpad registries, the tick-bitmap walk). It is loaded here under a private
package name rather than copied, so the skill and the engine can never disagree
about the math. What changes is who configures it: the RPC URL is the engine's
(``chains.rpc_url_for``) and is handed to the client explicitly, the skill's
dotenv loader is switched off, and its caches live under the engine's state
directory. Prices come from the engine's own lookup first and GeckoTerminal
second, through one process-wide :class:`PriceBook` that concurrent reads share.

The library does blocking HTTP, so every read runs in a worker thread; the
engine's async services (prices, the Blockscout indexer) are reached from that
thread through the event loop that started it.
